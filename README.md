# python-challenge-2021

Hello!

Welcome to my Python Challenge Repo. 
You will find both folders (PyBank/PyPoll) have 2 folders within them with the Resources(contains database) and the results printing into the Anaylsis folder. 

Please ignore .gitattributes, as I added large files. 

The "instructions.md" is the web link for the homework assigment

I have also provided both PyBank & PyPoll .txt code's in a notepad file.
